# Bioreactor Simulator with Deviation Alerts

The inspiration for this program stemmed from one of the issues I commonly face as a Research Associate 
in a fermentation lab. Once a fermentation run was started, there was not much to do besides the occasional sampling and
monitoring of the tank to ensure the tank is running at the correct specifications. The problem with tank monitoring is 
that it is difficult to keep an eye on the trends of each bioreactor at all times. In an R&D setting there are potentially many
bioreactors and this is complicated even further by the fact that the tanks are probably allocated to different projects with
 different 
process specifications. Typically, rounds are done every few hours to see how the tanks are doing and if a deviation is seen, 
chances are it has probably already been occurring for awhile and the tank has already failed because it has ran
outside of the specifications for so long. Losing tanks is extremely costly and the ability to increase the overall 
tank success rates is a major benefit. This program seeks to help out fermentation associates by sending email and text 
alerts within minutes of a mechanical deviation so that it can be caught very early with enough time to fix it and save 
the run.

##Process Description
This fermentation simulates a fed-batch process in which an acidic glucose feed, base and antifoam are added to the reactor. The feed is triggered once the microbes show signs of
starvation through the rise of the pH and DO. During the batch phase the pH is allowed to reach a value of 7.27,
indicating all the glucose is depleted. At this point, acidic feed will be added until the pH is dropped
to the set point (7.20). Since it takes time for the feed to homogenize with the tank broth, the pH will fall
below the set point which is why the base control is needed. When the feed is first triggered, the motor ramps to 1500 rpm
as the microbes are more metabolically active and will require more oxygen for the aerobic fermentation process.
Antifoam is added on a set schedule and turns on for every 3 hours for 10 minutes after an EFT of 10 hours is
reached.
    
### Process Specifications

        Agitation - 1000 rpm -> 1500 rpm ramp after the feed is triggered
        DO - Not controlled

    Additions
        Feed - triggered by pH
        Base - triggered by pH
        Antifoam - set time schedule

### [Demo Video](https://youtu.be/R_-4DszZCs4)
0:00 - 2:10 full fermentation run without any deviations  
2:10 - 5:24 run with deviations the notification system displayed

## Getting Started

Clone the repo: ```git clone https://github.com/Michaelli26/bioreactor-simulator```

### Prerequisites

```
pip install requirements.txt
```
### How to Run
Run ```simulatorpyqt.py``` to start the application

### How it Works
The bottom buttons alternate between changing the current top and bottom plots on display.
The top buttons introduce any of the possible 
deviations one at a time.

### Alert System
To use the email alert system, change the email addresses and update the password to an accessible account. To use the 
text alert system, an active Twilio account is needed. Both the email_alert and text_alert function calls 
(line 266 and 267) in deviation_notifier.py are commented out for these reasons.
